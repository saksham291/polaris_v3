As the name suggests, one learns both the science behind the computers and the engineering aspects of the field. CSE at IIT Bhilai is focussed on providing the students with a perfect blend of both – research and industrial facet of the computing world.</p><br>

                            <li class="info__item">Though it is not a pre-requisite but having an idea of coding (loops, basic syntax, conditionals, functions, a tiny bit of pointers), mainly C language would surely help you to catch pace during the various courses.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Get some knowledge about Linux based systems, mainly Ubuntu. There are plenty of resources on the net to help you install the same along with your Windows OS.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Having some knowledge of Python and MATLAB can be helpful in some courses as these languages are used as tools in their assignments (Digital Signal Processing).</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Advanced C concepts such as Algorithms and Data Structures can be studied. This will help you breeze through the basics in the classes and focus on more advanced concepts.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Try reading about analysis of algorithms, mainly in terms of time complexity.</li>
                            <li class="info__item">Some basic familiarity with Discrete Mathematics/Mathematical Logic will really help you in some of the courses but is not compulsory.</li>

In CSE we can see the result of our programming is on screen. And in Mechanical Engineering whatever is happening we can see it physically e.g. by applying force, weighing it etc. But in EE we can’t. First, we need to MODEL IT in MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS and then see, what is the output for input. So, topics in maths like Vector Calculus, Fourier and Laplace transforms, Differential Equations, Matrix Analysis are very important. Don’t detest these subjects.</li>
